This project is dedicated to help me Learn mobile app development. I am currently building an app called : Unitime.
    It's purpose ? simple, it is to help student better communicate when it comes to schedule changes and compus events.
    Because here is Algeria, those sudden changes take time to arrive to the students knowledge, that due to many reasons :
        - Because the administration publishes the updates in the official site of the university, which student don't visit often.
        - Also we tend to use google classroom, but it lack a visual representation.
        That where my app comes in, it will offer smooth ux/ui (which you will help me design in the future) a good calendar using SfCalendar.


The stack I am currently using :
    Front end: Flutter
    Back end : Spring boot with gradle, I initialized it with springInitializr.
    Database : PostgreSQL
